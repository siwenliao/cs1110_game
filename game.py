# We are simulating the game Fireboy and Watergirl,
# but a slightly more simple version.
# There will be two characters, Fireboy and Watergirl,
# who navigate through a "forest temple" (similar to Mario)
# from bottom to top. There will be fire and water as obstacles'
# for both characters. If they make it to the top,
# they complete the level and move on.

# 3 basic features:

# User Input: Fireboy will use the right, left, and up arrows to move,
# and Watergirl will use "S", "E", and "F" on the keyboard to move.

# Game Over: Both characters will have 3 lives combined.
# If they lose all 3 before they complete the levels, they lose.

# Graphics/Images: We can do graphics of fire and water,
# graphics of the characters, etc.

# 4 additional features:

# Object-oriented code: We will have a class for the characters,
# which has 2 instances. We will also have a class for the collectibles.

# Collectibles: We will have collectibles (fire coins for Fireboy
# and water coins for Watergirl)

# Multiple levels: Similar to how the game Fireboy and Watergirl
# has many levels, we will also create at least 3 levels.

# Restart from game over: When 3 lives (combined) are lost, players
# will have an option to restart from the beginning.
